  <h3><span style="font-family:helvetica">Phishing Scams </h3>
<p>Phishing scams are one of the most common schemes that scammers use to lure job applicants. This is when scammers would pretend to be a recruiter for a reputed or well-known company. About 46% of scam reports have been involving an impersonator. In these cases, applicants will be asked to send their personal information through the false application, such as their Social Security number or their bank information.</p>

  <h3><span style="font-family:helvetica">Job Fees </h3>
<p>Another common type of scam is when a "recruiter" asks for an advance fee from the applicant. This happens after the scammer has seen the applicant's application and then proceeds to a standard job hiring protocol, including discussing the fake work position and interviewing with the applicant. Once the scammers have deceived the applicant that they are giving them the job, they ask to receive a certain sum of money, saying that it is an advance fee that the applicant must send before the job starts. In cases like these, the money is always stolen, about 41% of employees have reported these types of scams. There has been a case in which a group of applicants got scammed on LinkedIn and lost between $200,000 to $1.6 million.</p>

  <h3><span style="font-family:helvetica">Hacking</h3>
<p>There have been cases in which job scammers were able to gain unauthorized access to the applicant’s electronic devices. Scammers would send messages or emails pretending to be a recruiter or a LinkedIn worker; the information in the messages sent would often include either a survey or link that contained a browser hijacking software. Reports have detected that 47% of employees have had their computer or phone hacked after clicking these links sent by scammers, that they believed to be job related messages.</p>

  <h3><span style="font-family:helvetica">Romance Scams</h3>
<p>A scamming technique that has made an appearance on LinkedIn in recent years is known as the romance scams. This starts with scammers sending out connection requests over the web. Once they have connected with LinkedIn members, they start to feign romantic interest, with the intent to allure their victims and eventually persuade them into sharing their social security and economic information. These types of scammers are often harder to detect, as usually their conversations are moved to unmonitored platforms once the scammer and the victim have built a “relationship”.</p>
